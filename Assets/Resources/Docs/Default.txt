# Note: If editing this file manually,
#       the spaces in the separator
#       are necessary! (, ) as is the
#       "NUL" text in the next task
#       column.
#
# It is important to classify your tasks correctly.  For example,
# Get Fuel has 4 Parts, DLT1,DLT2,DLT3 and DLT4, and the order matters.
# It always goes DLT1->DLT3->DLT2->DLT4.  If the computer decided which
# to start with based on the name, then either DLT1 or DLT2 could be
# selected as the starting task.  This would give 2 version DLT1->DLT3->DLT2->DLT4
# or DLT2->DLT4, which is not what we want.  Instead, anything marked as a
# "Chain Task" cannot be selected as a starting task.  I could have made it so that
# only "NUL" tasks could be selected as starting, but when I designed this early on,
# I hadn't yet though about how to signify that 2 tasks were meant to be chained.
# I genuinely thought about using a state number controlled on the phone side.
# This gave less versatility.  Maybe I wanted Fix Wriring to chain into Swipe card.
# I can do that this way, but I wouldn't be able to the other way.  When I added this
# approach it was long after classifying and selecting based on the Short/Long task label
# and so it has stayed.  Be careful with that.
#
# It's best to go through and think about which of the tasks are going to chain, before assigning
# which tasks chain to what.  Then after selecting you "Chain Tasks" assign all of the tasks
# that have "Chain Task, NUL" to have some sort of next task column value.
#
# Once I get the builder together it's probably better to use that...
#
# code, name, location, type, next task
